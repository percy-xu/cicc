# Small Cap Index

## What?

This project is an attempt to implement the [MSCI Small Cap Index](https://www.msci.com/eqb/gimi/smallcap/MSCI_May07_SCMethod.pdf) methodology in the China A-shares universe. My small cap index tests if excess returns among small-sized firms (i.e. the *SMB* effect in the [Fama-French 3-Factor Model](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x)) exists in the Chinese stock market.

## Why?

This is my first project at CICC, so mainly to get myself started as a quant researcher.
