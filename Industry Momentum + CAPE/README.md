# Industry Momentum + Shiller CAPE

## What?

### Goal

This project explores two asset price anomalies in the equities market: **momentum** and **value**. More specifically, I attempt to develop a strategy combining the industry momentum effect and the Shiller-CAPE ratio in the China A-shares stock market.

### Background

Both industry momentum effect and Shiller-CAPE ratio have received significant attention from scholars and investors since the 1990s. This section provides some background and relevant literatures for these two topics.

#### Industry Momentum

Eugene Fama, arguably the most prominent researcher on the Efficient Market Hypothesis once said that the momentum effect is *"perhaps the biggest embarrassment to the EMH"*. Indeed, according to the EMH the momentum should not exist at all because past returns and future returns are completely irrelevant. Yet, momentum has been generating consistent excess returns since it was first proposed in [Jegadeesh (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2328882) over the last three decades.

The question that follows is naturally: *"What causes momentum?"* [Moskowitz (1999)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/798005) offers an interesting theory: **momentum effects can be explained by industries**. Moskowitz concluded that stocks within the same industry are under the same regulatory constraints and affected by the same external factors, which causes their stock prices to move in the same direction. Further, the momentum effect largely disappears once industry is being controlled.

So the next question is: *If industries do explain momentum, then why bother with individual stocks?* Moskowitz answers this question as well. He made a portfolio consisted of industry indices only and rotated among the recent winning industries, and found that the excess return exceeds that of a portfolio of recent winning individual stocks.
